# Agent State

## Context
## Recent Decisions
- Sprint 7 (fast-track, 1 phase, STORY-FING-22, 3 pts) planned 2026-08-08 and launched same day.
  Board for Sprint 7 was `docs/USER_STORIES_SPRINT7.md`, not `task.md` (1-phase sprint).
- No Tank tasks in any sprint so far — no deploy/infra/CI scope.

## Key Findings (as of 2026-10-12 status check)
- No active sprint. Sprints 1-7 all closed; last commit b91470b (2026-08-08) shipped Sprint 7.
- Tests at last verified run: 88/88 (Cypher's correction, 2026-08-08). Not re-run on 2026-10-12.
- `task.md` is STALE: header says Sprint 6, all 13 boxes unchecked despite "Complete (Launched)",
  and it points at the old `agents/mouse.docs/sprint_log.md` path. Sprint 7 never written to it.
- Working tree has a large uncommitted bob-protocol migration: `agents/<persona>.docs/` -> 
  `agents/<persona>/` (107 deletions, 9 untracked persona dirs), `SKILL.md.txt` files removed,
  plus untracked `.claude/`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/`, root `AGENT.md`.
- Open backlog (1 item, unscheduled): bracket-markup sweep in `examples/demo.py` narrative text —
  rich `Text()`/`Text.append()` print `[bold red]..[/bold red]` literally. Filed by Smith to Cypher.
- Never done: interactive `sudo make demo-live` pass on a real TTY for Sprint 7 (Neo flagged, no TTY).

## Important Notes
- Board of record is root `task.md` per Global Agent Standard #11 — no secondary sprint file.
- 2026-10-12 Sprint 8 planned: task.md rewritten (was stale Sprint 6 board), 4 phases one story each, order FING-23 -> 25 -> 24 -> 26.
- 2026-10-12 Sprint 8 closed: 16/16 pts, 4 phases, 1 fix cycle. task.md shows it complete with the retro backlog.

## Current Task
**Sprint:** 8 — Fingerprint Sampling CLI (`docs/USER_STORIES_SPRINT8.md`, board: `task.md`)
**Status:** Sprint 8 complete

## Next Steps
No active sprint. On *sm plan: start a new board in task.md; backlog section there is the input.
