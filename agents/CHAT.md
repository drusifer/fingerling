> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_8.md` (2026-10-12 21:29:12) — Sprint 8 - Fingerprint Sampling CLI (2026-10-12). Tier 1, 16/16 pts, STORY-FING-23..26. Delivered python -m fingerling fingerprint: merges any JSONL event stream into a growing, profile-bound fingerprint set; python-jsonpath replaces the hand-rolled resolver; SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/LAST(n) aggregators; YAML profiles; project .venv via make install. Both Smith gates approved with additions; 4 phases passed UAT and review first time; one cosmetic fix after user testing. 178 tests. This archive also holds the Sprint 1-7 log, which had never been archived.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_9.md` (2026-10-13 00:09:31) — Sprint 9 - Fingerprint Package + SDLC Tooling (2026-10-12/13). First sprint run under docs/SDLC.md, on branch sprint-9. Delivered STORY-FING-27..30 (18/18 pts): uv with a committed lockfile, ruff and gitleaks gates, Python 3.10-3.13, CI and PyPI trusted-publishing workflows, the fingerprint tool split out as the fingerprint-sampler package (command: fingerprint merge), and this per-phase chat report. Planning also contains the pre-sprint build bootstrap and SDLC decisions. Released as fingerprint-sampler 0.1.0 (tag v0.1.0), merged to main, not pushed.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_POST_SPRINT_9.md` (2026-10-13 20:02:25) — Maintenance after Sprint 9 (2026-10-13), each change on its own fix/ branch and merged to main: one Makefile with no team-tooling targets; documentation tree groomed (sprint stories to docs/sprints/, README map, agents index); nine stale agents/tools copies of bobp tools removed; session close-out. In bob_protocol (uncommitted there): bobp tldr now uses the system via command and indexes first, and bobp setup-agent-links removes the legacy tool copies. No release - the published package did not change.

[<small>2026-10-13 20:02:26</small>] [**Mouse**]->[**all**] *sm handoff*:
 Session closed. No sprint in flight. main = Sprint 9 + four merged fix/ branches, tagged v0.1.0, ahead of origin, nothing pushed. Waiting on the owner: PyPI one-time setup, push main, push the tag, bob_protocol sync. Queued next: artifact rubrics (owner to pick the pilot). To resume: read task.md, docs/SDLC.md and agents/mouse/state.md; next sprint is sprint-10, next story STORY-FING-31. Active scope is the fingerprint tool only.
