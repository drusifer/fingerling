> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_8.md` (2026-10-12 21:29:12) — Sprint 8 - Fingerprint Sampling CLI (2026-10-12). Tier 1, 16/16 pts, STORY-FING-23..26. Delivered python -m fingerling fingerprint: merges any JSONL event stream into a growing, profile-bound fingerprint set; python-jsonpath replaces the hand-rolled resolver; SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/LAST(n) aggregators; YAML profiles; project .venv via make install. Both Smith gates approved with additions; 4 phases passed UAT and review first time; one cosmetic fix after user testing. 178 tests. This archive also holds the Sprint 1-7 log, which had never been archived.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_9.md` (2026-10-13 00:09:31) — Sprint 9 - Fingerprint Package + SDLC Tooling (2026-10-12/13). First sprint run under docs/SDLC.md, on branch sprint-9. Delivered STORY-FING-27..30 (18/18 pts): uv with a committed lockfile, ruff and gitleaks gates, Python 3.10-3.13, CI and PyPI trusted-publishing workflows, the fingerprint tool split out as the fingerprint-sampler package (command: fingerprint merge), and this per-phase chat report. Planning also contains the pre-sprint build bootstrap and SDLC decisions. Released as fingerprint-sampler 0.1.0 (tag v0.1.0), merged to main, not pushed.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_POST_SPRINT_9.md` (2026-10-13 20:02:25) — Maintenance after Sprint 9 (2026-10-13), each change on its own fix/ branch and merged to main: one Makefile with no team-tooling targets; documentation tree groomed (sprint stories to docs/sprints/, README map, agents index); nine stale agents/tools copies of bobp tools removed; session close-out. In bob_protocol (uncommitted there): bobp tldr now uses the system via command and indexes first, and bobp setup-agent-links removes the legacy tool copies. No release - the published package did not change.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_10.md` (2026-10-13 20:13:52) — Sprint 10 - Artifact Rubrics (2026-10-13), on branch sprint-10. Delivered STORY-FING-31..34 (10/10 pts): an inventory of the artifacts agents produce and a standard rubric format (agents/templates/ARTIFACTS.md); a sprint stories template with a STORIES rubric applied at Smith's Gate 1; SDLC and LESSON rubrics applied by Oracle at groom and Smith at the close test; and a calibration on existing documents that reworded three criteria and found one stale statement in the SDLC. Process-only sprint: no release, nothing pushed.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_10_CLOSE.md` (2026-10-13 20:15:33) — Sprint 10 close, recorded late (2026-10-13). Supplement to CHAT_SPRINT_10: twelve messages - the Phase 4 handoffs, the close marker, Smith's approval, the retros and the launch - were never posted during the sprint because two over-length bobp chat calls failed silently and cancelled the commands chained after them. The work had been done before the merge; these messages were posted afterwards on branch fix/sprint-10-record. Also holds the review of the lesson written about it and of the SDLC edit that now requires checking the record before merging.

[<small>2026-10-13 20:15:44</small>] [**Mouse**]->[**all**] *sm handoff*:
 Sprint 10 closed; its record is in CHAT_SPRINT_10 (planning, phases 1-4) and CHAT_SPRINT_10_CLOSE (the close, posted late). No sprint in flight. main holds Sprint 10 plus this record fix, no tag, not pushed. To resume: read task.md, docs/SDLC.md and agents/mouse/state.md; next sprint is sprint-11, next story STORY-FING-35. Open for the owner: confirm that any Weak rubric criterion should block a gate; check the first CI run.

[<small>2026-10-13 22:03:41</small>] [**Bob**]->[**all**] *prompt update*:
 Removed the three legacy state templates (_template_context, _template_current_task, _template_next_steps): they belong to the retired three-file state layout and upstream no longer ships them. Stories template story-ID line made generic (STORY-{KEY}-{id}) to match the upstream copy. agents/skills and agents/templates now match bob_protocol exactly. Branch fix/remove-legacy-templates.

---
[<small>2026-10-13 22:05:35</small>] [**Bob**]->[**all**] *prompt update*:
 agents/AGENTS.md synced with the upstream copy, which now carries the SDLC guideline. Fingerling was behind upstream here: it still described the retired three-file state layout and bare make. It now says state.md and bobp make, matching what the personas already do. Branch fix/sync-agents-md.
